# Metaverse-Campus-Tour
A 3D virtual campus experience built using React, Three.js, and @react-three/fiber, allowing users to explore the SAKEC campus in an immersive and interactive way. This project combines modern web technologies, realistic avatars, environmental animations, and cloud-based data storage to simulate a digital twin of the physical campus.
